# SDLC Plan
For this project, our team is going to be using Scrum. We will utilize the "daily" stand-up meeting, but we will be meeting once a week. At this meeting we will plan ahead for the following week to meet the Milestone deadlines as well as review the progress made in the previous week. This will allow us to make changes to the application as they are needed for each milestone.

We are going to continue to use Slack as our main form of communication as well as for tracking our task progress. When the project is being built, this will also allow us to have GitHub notifications sent to Slack for build alerts, like you would find in a company that uses Continuous Integration and Continuous Development.

## Roles
In order to utilize Scrum, our team needs a Scrum Master. Since we all could benefit from the responsibility of this role, we will be breaking up the role into four smaller parts, defined here:
* Pull items from the backlog into the sprint, before the stand-up meeting. This will be the "sprint planning role".
* Assigning story points to tickets (to-dos in Slack) and assigning them to developers. This will ensure everyone is doing the same amount of work each week. This will be the "grooming role".
* Reviewing pull requests and merges to maintain code consistency. This will be the "code reviewer" role.
* Making sure the team is following all project requirements. This will be the "project manager role".

These roles will change every week to ensure we are all getting appropriate experience.

## Backlog and Tickets
In order to simulate a full Scrum environment, we will have a backlog with tickets and a current sprint where we can pull tickets into from the backlog.

Since we do not have the resources to use a real PM software like JIRA, we will use our Slack server to manage these tickets and sprints, utilizing a number of free Slack plugins. These plugins will allow us to create tickets, assign story points, and assign the tickets to developers.

## Grooming and Planning
During our weekly "stand-up" meeting, we will plan the sprint for the next week by assigning tickets to developers, trying to give everyone the same number of story points to ensure fairness.

The tickets will be "groomed" (story points assigned) throughout the week by the person holding the "grooming role".

## Code Reviews
During the weekly "stand-up" meeting, we will also review any pull requests or merges into the master branch of our main repository. This will be done to ensure we are maintaining code consistency and preventing bugs from entering the program.
